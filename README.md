# Municipality Services Application

This application is a **Windows Forms Application** that uses C# .NET 9.0. It allows users to log and track municipal service issues in a professional, user-friendly way.

The application was designed with a clean UI, proper validation, and custom-built data structures.

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo Video
A video demonstration of the application running will be provided here: 
**YouTube Link:** _to be added_

In the video I demonstrate: 
- Opening the dashboard
- Navigating with the sidebar
- Submitting a new issue with validation 
- Adding attachments
- Viewing the saved issue in the _data_ folder

## âœ… Features
- **Professional UI**
  - A dashboard with sidebar navigation and modern icons  
  - A report form with responsive layout  
  - Consistent fonts and theme inspired by eThekwini Municipality  

- **Custom Data Structions** 
    - A `ForwardList<T>` (singly linked list) to store issues and attachments
    - This replaces built-in generic collections like `List<>` and arrays

- **Validation Rules**
    - **Location:** Required, minimum of 5 characters. The location is validated against the OpenStreetMap Nominatim service.
    - **Category:** Required (selected from dropdown).
    - **Description:** Required, minimum of 5 words.
    - **Attachments:** Required, at least one attachment. Allowed types are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.heic`, or `.pdf`, and each file must be â‰¤ 10 MB.

- **Progress Feedback:**  
  - A progress bar updates as fields are validated, so users know when the form is complete.  


- **Storage:**  
  - Issues are saved to text files in a `Data` folder (with unique ticket IDs).  
  - Attachments are copied into a dedicated folder with unique filenames.
